# Project Title:
Predict Resturant Ratings Using linear regression and decision tree regression in Machine Learning Technology.

# Objective: 
To build a machine learning model to predict the aggregate rating of a restaurant based on other features.

# Steps:

1.Preprocess the dataset by handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and splitting the data into training and testing sets.

2.Select a regression algorithm (e.g., linear regression, decision tree regression) and train it on the training data.

3.Evaluate the model's performance using appropriate regression metrics (e.g., mean squared error, R-squared) on the testing data.

4.Interpret the model's results and analyze the most influential features affecting restaurant ratings.
